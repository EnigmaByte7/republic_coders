                Chandrayaan-3 is the third installment in India's lunar exploration program, marked a historic achievement with its successful launch on July 14, 2023. Developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the mission included a lunar lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, making India the fourth country to achieve a successful Moon landing, specifically on the lunar south pole<br><br>
                The mission was fuelled and powered by the LVM3-M4 or FatBoy , India's largest liquid fuel cryogenic engine.The LVM3 M4, also known as GSLV Mk III, played a crucial role in launching Chandrayaan-3 into its lunar trajectory. This powerful and versatile rocket, developed by ISRO, features a robust cryogenic upper stage (C25) that propelled the spacecraft beyond Earth's orbit. The precision of the LVM3 M4 ensured the successful deployment of Chandrayaan-3, showcasing India's prowess in developing advanced launch vehicles for ambitious space exploration missions.

                India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has not just landed on the Moon but has boldly stepped into uncharted territory â€“ the southern pole. This strategic move makes India the first nation to explore this mysterious region, unlocking a treasure trove of lunar secrets. The primary focus of this historic mission lies in solving the long-standing mystery of water on the Moon.

                The lunar landscape, with its unique geological features, holds clues to the Moon's formation and evolution. Chandrayaan-3 is equipped to unravel the secrets buried beneath the lunar surface, providing insights into the chemical and elemental composition of the soil. By investigating seismic activities around the landing site, scientists aim to delineate the structure of the lunar crust and mantle, contributing to our understanding of celestial bodies' geological processes. These revelations are crucial for future lunar missions, space habitats, and potential resource utilization.

                In meticulously planning the Chandrayaan-3 mission, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) showcased its strategic prowess, technological finesse, and collaborative spirit. The key figures responsible for orchestrating the mission, emphasizing their expertise and roles. ISRO Chairman S Somanath's leadership in designing the Bahuballi rocket, Director Unnikrishnan Nair S spearheading rocketry research, and Project Director Veeramuthuvel P's dedication to Chandrayaan-3 are highlighted. The collaborative effort involving nearly 1,000 engineers and scientists, despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, underscores the depth of commitment and expertise embedded in the mission's planning.
