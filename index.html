                India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has not just landed on the Moon but has boldly stepped into uncharted
                territory – the southern pole. This strategic move makes India the first nation to explore this
                mysterious region, unlocking a treasure trove of lunar secrets. The primary focus of this historic
                mission lies in solving the long-standing mystery of water on the Moon.

                The lunar landscape, with its unique geological features, holds clues to the Moon's formation and
                evolution. Chandrayaan-3 is equipped to unravel the secrets buried beneath the lunar surface, providing
                insights into the chemical and elemental composition of the soil. By investigating seismic activities
                around the landing site, scientists aim to delineate the structure of the lunar crust and mantle,
                contributing to our understanding of celestial bodies' geological processes. These revelations are
                crucial for future lunar missions, space habitats, and potential resource utilization.

                <span id="quote">"Chandrayaan-3 is all about doing more with less. When a country has limited
                    capabilities but dreams big, it has to be smart to use the love and gravity of Mother Earth to go
                    all the way to the moon.” said S. Somanath, ISRO chairman</span><br><br>
                LVM-3 may be a bahubali, but it still lacked the punch to send the 3,921kg Chandrayaan-3 satellite on a
                direct flight to the moon. ISRO engineers devised a way to overcome this big problem―use the earth’s
                gravity to slingshot Chandrayaan-3 to the moon. Using the spacecraft’s propulsion module, the scientists
                gradually kept raising its orbit and velocity. On August 1, Chandrayaan-3 attained enough ‘escape
                velocity’ to leave Mother Earth’s loving hold and go on its solitary journey of 3.84 lakh kilometres to
                the moon.
                <br><br>
                <span id="quote">“This was a very, very tricky operation requiring great precision, since the approach
                    velocity had to be just right,” said S. Somanath, ISRO chairman. If it were too fast, the satellite
                    would have bounced off and become a flyby mission. If it were too slow, it could have been pulled in
                    and crash-landed on the lunar surface.</span>

                Nilesh Desai, Director of ISRO's Space Applications Centre, said the rover's movement was impacted by
                visibility issues, boulders, and craters on the lunar surface. The South Pole of the Moon has an uneven
                surface and very deep craters, that are making it difficult for the rover to move freely and smoothly.
                The other day, the rover faced its first obstacle when it located a 4-meter diameter crater positioned
                three meters ahead of its location. The ISRO redirected the rover to a safer path. Chandrayaan-3 Pragyan

                    The Chandrayaan-3, consisting of a propulsion module, a lander and a
                    rover, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit. Using the fuel in
                    the propulsion module, the spacecraft's orbit was raised in 5 stages
                    (July 5, 17, 18, 20 and 25). At its closest point (perigee), the orbit
                    was 170 km away from the Earth and and 36,500 km at its farthest point
                    (apogee).
                    The spacecraft moved into lunar orbit on August 1.
                    It entered the Moon's gravitational field on August 5.
                    There, starting with an ellipse, the diameter was reduced
                    and the orbit lowered in four stages (August 6, 9, 14 and 16).
                    The spacecraft switched over to a circular orbit when it

                S. Somanath, the chairman of ISRO, described this process as “15 minutes of terror” for them. It
                includes four phases:
                <br><br>
                1. The Rough Braking phase includes reducing the lander’s horizontal velocity from a range of 1.68
                km/sec (more than 6,000 km/h) at a height of 30 km from the lunar surface, to almost zero for a soft
                landing at the designated site. This has to be done with precision, within certain durations.
                <br><br>
                2. At a height of 7.42 km from the surface, the lander is to go into an “attitude hold phase” lasting
                around 10 seconds, during which it should tilt from a horizontal to a vertical position while covering a
                distance of 3.48 km.
                <br><br>
                3. The “fine braking phase” lasts around 175 seconds, during which the lander is to move fully into a
                vertical position. It is to traverse the final 28.52 km to the landing site, the altitude will come down
                to 800-1,000 m, and it would reach a nominal speed of 0 m/sec.
                <br><br>
                4. “Terminal descent” is the final stage, when the spacecraft is supposed to descend totally vertically
                onto the surface.

                The rover, Pragyan, designed for the Chandrayaan-3 mission, boasts a mission life of one lunar day,
                equivalent to 14 Earth days. Weighing in at 26 kg, this compact explorer operates with a power of 50 W,
                ensuring its agility and efficiency on the lunar surface. With dimensions measuring 917 x 750 x 397
                mm³.It is moving with an average speed of 1cm/sec. Pragyan is equipped with two payloads for scientific
                exploration. Communication is established through the lander, facilitating the transmission of valuable

                Dance, Sweets and Smiles : after a 40-day trip from the space center in Sriharikota, our Chandrayaan-3
                made it to the moon on August 23. The Vikram lander gently landed at 6:04 PM IST

                Everybody, not just the space scientists but also regular people, schools, the army, and even
                politicians, were super excited. Schools all over the country celebrated. Kids and teachers were happy
                about what we achieved in space.

                Politicians from different parties joined in to say congratulations to ISRO.
                <br><br>
                As Chandrayaan 3 accomplishes a secure lunar landing, social media buzzes with pride and well-wishes.
                The Chandrayaan-3 itself takes center stage in these reactions. It sent its first message,
                congratulating India on reaching its destination. <br><br><span id="quote">Chandrayaan-3 Mission:
                    'India, I reached my destination and you too!':Chandrayaan-3</span>

                The smiles and excitement in the eyes of the people is enough to warm the heart and capture the essence
                of a moment filled with joy and pride.

                Back in 2014, ISRO successfully became the fourth organisation in the world to insert its orbiter
                ‘Mangalyaan’ into the Martian orbit in the first attempt. The mission garnered massive glory for the
                country. But the feat was acknowledged in a rather racial way by the New York Times. The outlet issued a
                cartoon on the mission’s success, which offended many Indians.

                the Moon and became the first and the only nation to do so.
                The Indian folks take a dig at the US based New York Times by sharing new cartoons depiciting the
                success of ISRO, finally New York Times issued an official apology and claimed that there were no

                engineers work tirelessly for four years , to bring the dream into reality. This energy and excitement
                even did not diminish a little during the rough phase of covid-19.
                Though there are thousands of intelligent names, however some of those smart people are worth knowing..
